Description: GNU C Library: National Language (locale) data [support]
 Machine-readable data files, shared objects and programs used by the
 C library for localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) support.
 .
 This package contains the libc.mo i18n files, plus tools to generate
 locale definitions from source files (included in this package). It allows
 you to customize which definitions actually get generated. This is a
 savings over how this package used to be, where all locales were generated
 by default. This created a package that unpacked to an excess of 30 megs.
