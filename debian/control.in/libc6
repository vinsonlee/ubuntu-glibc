Depends: libc6 (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Libraries with debugging symbols
 Contains unstripped shared libraries.
 This package is provided primarily to provide a backtrace with
 names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret core
 dumps. The libraries are installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be
 used by placing that directory in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 Most people will not need this package.

Depends: libc6 (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: PIC archive library
 Contains an archive library (ar file) composed of individual shared objects.
 This is used for creating a library which is a smaller subset of the
 standard libc shared library. The reduced library is used on the Debian
 boot floppies. If you are not making your own set of Debian boot floppies
 using the `boot-floppies' package, you probably don't need this package.
