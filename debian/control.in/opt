Package: libc6-sparcv9b
Architecture: sparc
Section: libs
Priority: extra
Pre-Depends: libc6 (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Shared libraries [v9b optimized]
 Contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
 the system. This package includes shared versions of the standard C
 library and the standard math library, as well as many others.
 .
 This set of libraries is optimized for the UltraSPARC v9b ABI. It only
 needs to be installed on UltraSPARC machines. If you install this on a
 non-UltraSPARC, it won't even be used.
 .
 WARNING: Some commercial programs do not work well with these libraries.
 Most notably, IBM's JDK. If you experience problems with such
 applications, you will need to remove this package.
