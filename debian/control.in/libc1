Section: libdevel
Priority: extra
Depends: libc1 (= ${Source-Version})
Description: GNU C Library: Libraries with debugging symbols
 Contains unstripped shared libraries.
 This package is provided primarily to provide a backtrace with
 names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret core

 Contains an archive library (ar file) composed of individual shared objects.
 This is used for creating a library which is a smaller subset of the
 standard libc shared library. The reduced library is used on the Debian

 using the `boot-floppies' package, you probably don't need this package.
