#  When glibc is uploaded into unstable, the locales package is immediately
#  available because it is arch:all.  But libc binary packages are processed
#  by autobuilders and become available later.
#
#  If compiling locales depend on a given version of localedef (for instance
#  when ISO codes are updated), the idea is to first bump LOCALES_COMPAT_VER and
#  make an upload without changing locales.  When this version is available on
#  all architectures in unstable, locales can be modified and LOCALES_DEP_VER
#  is bumped too.
#
#  LOCALES_COMPAT_VER must always contain two values during the transition phase
#  so that dependencies in unstable can always be satisfied, and
#  LOCALES_DEP_VER point to the highest value of LOCALES_COMPAT_VER when
#  packages are available for all architectures in unstable.
