    Do not fail if one of the two responses to AF_UNSPEC fails (BZ #14308)
    
    [Fixes BZ #14308, #12994, #13651]
    
    AF_UNSPEC results in sending two queries in parallel, one for the A
    record and the other for the AAAA record.  If one of these is a
    referral, then the query fails, which is wrong.  It should return at
    least the one successful response.
    
    The fix has two parts.  The first part makes the referral fall back to
    the SERVFAIL path, which results in using the successful response.
    There is a bug in that path however, due to which the second part is
    necessary.  The bug here is that if the first response is a failure
    and the second succeeds, __libc_res_nsearch does not detect that and
    assumes a failure.  The case where the first response is a success and
    the second fails, works correctly.
    
    This condition is produced by buggy routers, so here's a crude
    interposable library that can simulate such a condition.  The library
    overrides the recvfrom syscall and modifies the header of the packet
    received to reproduce this scenario.  It has two key variables:
    mod_packet and first_error.
    
    The mod_packet variable when set to 0, results in odd packets being
    modified to be a referral.  When set to 1, even packets are modified
    to be a referral.
    
    The first_error causes the first response to be a failure so that a
    domain-appended search is performed to test the second part of the
    __libc_nsearch fix.
    
    The driver for this fix is a simple getaddrinfo program that does an
    AF_UNSPEC query.  I have omitted this since it should be easy to
    implement.
    
    I have tested this on x86_64.

    /* Override recvfrom and modify the header of the first DNS response to make it
       a referral and reproduce bz #845218.  We have to resort to this ugly hack
       because we cannot make bind return the buggy response of a referral for the
       AAAA record and an authoritative response for the A record.  */
