 # mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line

-# An Anglo-French Conference on Time-Keeping at Sea (June, 1917) agreed that
-# legal time on the high seas would be zone time, i.e., the standard time at
-# the nearest meridian that is a multiple of fifteen degrees.  The date is
+# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
 # governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
 # places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
 # an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
 # correct date is ambiguous.
+
+# From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone> (2005-08-31):
+# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
+# their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's
+# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's
+# meridian (12 o'clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
+# Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
+# ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
+# on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
+# nation it would use that nation's standard time.  The captain was permitted
+# to change his ship's clocks at a time of his choice following his ship's
+# entry into another zone time--he often chose midnight.  These zones were
+# adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
+# independent merchant ships until World War II.

 # What time is it in Indiana?
-# </a> (1999-04-06)
+# </a> (2005-10-30)
 #
-# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
-# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
-# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
-# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
-# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
-# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
-# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
-# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-01-20):
+# Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
+# with the following exceptions:
+#
+# - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
+#   Vandenburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
+#
+# - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
+#
+# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
+#   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
+#
+# - Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, and Pulaski counties
+#   have been like America/Indiana/Vincennes.
 #
-# Since 1970, EST-only Indiana has been like America/Indianapolis,
-# with exceptions noted below for Crawford, Starke, and Switzerland counties.
-# The parts of Indiana not listed below have been like America/Chicago,
-# America/Louisville, or America/New_York.
+# - Crawford, Pike, Starke, and Switzerland counties have their own time zone
+#   histories as noted below.
+#
+# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
+# and wrote ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
 #
 # Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
 # that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
 # So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.
-#
-# Most of EST-only Indiana last observed DST in 1970.
 
-# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06), following a tip by Markus Kuhn:
-# Pam Belluck reported in the New York Times (2001-01-31) that the
-# Indiana Legislature is considering a bill to adopt DST statewide.
-# Her article mentioned Vevay, whose post office observes a different
-# time zone from Danner's Hardware across the street.
+# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-16):
+# http://www.mccsc.edu/time.html says that Indiana will use DST starting 2006.
+
+# From Deborah Goldsmith (2006-01-18):
+# http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf95/382329_web.pdf
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-01-20):
+# It says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
+# Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
+# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
+# this rule is 2:OO a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
+# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
+# Strictly speaking, this means the affected counties will change their
+# clocks twice that night, but this obviously is in error.  The intent
+# is that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

+# CBC news also reported that Prince Edward Island is the first
+# province in Atlantic Canada to follow the US change, and that Quebec
+# had agreed; see <http://www.cbc.ca/pei/story/pe_daylight_20051207.html>
+# (2005-12-07).
+#
+# To reflect all this, the Canada and Winn rules have been adjusted to
+# agree with the 2007 US change.  This means we assume most of Canada
+# will fall into line.  However, Alberta, British Columbia,
+# Newfoundland, Northwest Territories, and Yukon already have separate
+# rules in our database, so for now we'll leave them alone, which
+# means that we currently assume these regions will not change their
+# rules and will disagree with the US starting in 2007.  This
+# assumption is probably incorrect, with the possible exception of
+# Newfoundland.  We plan to adjust the Edm, Vanc, StJohns, and NT_YK
+# rules as the corresponding provinces make their announcements.

+# From Paul Eggert (2005-05-01):
+# The decree doesn't say anything about daylight saving, but for now let's
+# assume that it is daylight saving and that they'll switch back on the
+# 3rd Sunday in September.

+# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-21):
+# The Associated Press story on the time change, which can be found at
+# http://www.lapalmainteractivo.com/guias/content/gen/ap/America_Latina/AMC_GEN_NICARAGUA_HORA.html
+# and elsewhere, says (fifth paragraph, translated from Spanish):  "The last
+# time that a change of clocks was applied to save energy was in the year 2000
+# during the Arnoldo Aleman administration."...
+# The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
+# since December 1998.  I wasn't able to find any details of Nicaraguan time
+# changes in 2000.  Perhaps a note could be added to the northamerica file, to
+# the effect that we have indirect evidence that DST was observed in 2000.
+#
+# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2005-11-02):
+# Nicaragua left DST the 2005-10-02 at 00:00 (local time).
