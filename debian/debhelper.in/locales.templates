Choices: ${locales}
_Description: Select locales to be generated.
 Locale is a framework to switch between multiple languages for users who can
 select to use their language, country, characters, collation order, etc.
 .
 Choose which locales to generate.  The selection will be saved to
 `/etc/locale.gen', which you can also edit manually (you need to run
 `locale-gen' afterwards).

Template: locales/default_environment_locale
Type: select
_Choices: None, ${locales}
Default: None
_Description: Which locale should be the default in the system environment?
 Many packages in Debian use locales to display text in the correct
 language for users. You can change the default locale if you're not
 a native English speaker.
 These choices are based on which locales you have chosen to generate.
 .
 Note: This will select the language for your whole system. If you're
 running a multi-user system where not all of your users speak the language
 of your choice, then they will run into difficulties and you might want
 not to set a default locale.
