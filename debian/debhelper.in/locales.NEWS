locales (2.3.6-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Locale variables are now stored in /etc/default/locale and no more
    /etc/environment.  The reason is that Debian Policy forbids modifying
    configuration files of other packages, and /etc/environment is a
    configuration file for PAM.
    Make sure to remove old definitions from /etc/environment, this file
    is no more modified for the reason explained above.
