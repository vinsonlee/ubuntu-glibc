glibc (2.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

 Starting with version 2.6.1, glibc ships a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf that
 enforces /usr/local/lib to take precedence over /usr/lib. This is the
 intended behaviour (it works like the $PATH where /usr/local/bin takes
 precedence over /usr/bin).

 To revert that (though doing so is discouraged) you can add /usr/lib to the
 beginning of /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf. (see bug#440394).

glibc (2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

 Starting with version 2.5-1, the glibc requires a 2.6.1 or later 
 kernel.  If you use a 2.4 kernel, please upgrade it *before*
 installing glibc.

 This also means that it is not possible to use LD_ASSUME_KERNEL with a
 version lower than 2.6.1. If you have set such a thing in /etc/profile, 
 ~/.bashrc or any other initialization file (something you should have
 never done!!!), please remove that *before* installing glibc.

 Note: This does not apply to the m68k architecture and to non-Linux
       kernels.
