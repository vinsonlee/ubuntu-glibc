    remove the corresponding tweaks done after the make install phase.
  * Install the 32-bit libraries in /emul/ia32-linux(/usr)/lib on amd64.
  * Only create the multiarch directories and the symlinks in /lib/ldconfig
    for the main pass. Otherwise alternate libraries would conflict with the

     this field to more locales.
   * locale-gen: Replace 'test ... -a ...' by two tests.
   * Add an "All locales" option to the locales/locales_to_be_generated

  * Build with the compiler defined as default for glibc (ie currently
    gcc-4.0) instead of gcc on amd64.
  * Decrease priorities of 64-bit main and -dev packages to standard
    and optional for all architectures. It better matches override,
    though it will still have to be changed.

    from Randolph Chung.  (Closes: #326581)
  * Switch to gcc-4.0 on hppa.
  * Add support for extra_pkg_install hooks for udeb packages.

    - Create (/usr)/lib/$(config-machine)-$(config-os) and add symlinks to
      these directories in /lib/ldconfig/
    - Add rtld.diff (add a new configuration variable rtlddir to change the
      dynamic linker in the ELF binaries) partly from Andreas Jochen. This is
      necessary to be able to install a glibc in the multiarch dir while still
      conforming to the various ABIs which specify a linker in /lib or /lib64.
  * Remove the patch to install the libc into /lib instead of /lib64 on
    amd64. Use the new libdir, slibdir and rtlddir options in configparm to

      - debian/po/fi.po: Added.
      - debian/patches/glibc23-mips-lazy-eval.dpatch: Added, drop dl-machine.h

  * GOTO Masanori <gotom@debian.org>

    * The complete libc6 installation breakage is fixed when hwcap packages
      (libc6-i686 and libc6-sparcv9/sparcv9b) is installed.  It introduced
      /etc/ld.so.hwcappkgs to track hwcap packages.
      - debian/debhelper.in/libc.postinst: Create /etc/ld.so.hwcappkgs if
        such file is not existed.  Check hwcap packages and decide to keep
        /etc/ld.so.nohwcap.  Put special ld.so.nohwcap string when the
        downgraded version does not support ld.so.hwcappkgs.
      - debian/debhelper.in/libc-otherbuild.postinst: When it's configured,
        check /etc/ld.so.hwcappkgs and decides to keep /etc/ld.so.nohwcap.
      - debian/debhelper.in/libc-otherbuild.postrm: When it's removed,
        check /etc/ld.so.hwcappkgs and search other hwcap package's version
        consistency.  Then it decides to remove /etc/ld.so.nohwcap.
      - debian/debhelper.in/libc.postrm: Leave /etc/ld.so.nohwcap if it's
        downgrade to hwcappkgs incompatible version.
      - debian/rules.d/debhelper.mk: Include "libc-" into OPT string

      - glibc234-hppa-linesep.dpatch: Add to fix hppa compilation failure.
      - glibc234-hppa-remove-mallocdef.dpatch: Add to
        fix hppa compilation breakage until ldcw lock change is introduced.
        This patch will be removed when ldcw patch is revised to apply.
      - glibc234-m68k-linuxthreads-fPIC.dpatch: Add to fix m68k compilation

      - glibc23-sse-oldkernel.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - hppa-drop-utimes.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - ldconfig.dpatch: The previous patch seems being wrong because it
        supresses all warnings about error.  The new patch I introduced should
        not warn during debootstrap, and works finely during normal operation.
      - ldd.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - ldso-disable-hwcap.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - locale-no_NO.dpatch: Drop locale.alias part which is already applied.

        binutils related problem should be occured.  It's disabled for a
        while, then remove iff no problem is reported.
      - alpha-pic.dpatch: #175511 said the upstream should have another 
        different fix.  After confirmation, it should be removed.
      - arm-output-format.dpatch: I believe the recent arm glibc should work
        without this patch.  If arm still has problem, then enable it.
      - glibc232-globfree-clear.dpatch: The latest upstream has gl_pathv=NULL 
        part, bug gl_pathc=0 part.  I think the current code is harmless.
        It needs confirmation to Jeff Licquia.
      - translation-fr.dpatch: The upstream rejects this wishlist bug.  After 
        confirmation, it'll be removed.
      - mips-asm-unistd.dpatch: I need to look at the result of the current cvs
        unistd.h.

    - debian/debhelper.in/*: Use debhelper for all package management.
    - debian/rules.d/*: Split out rules file into logical pieces.
    - debian/local/*: Move all of the files that Debian provides to here.

    Update dpatch to more closely match the debian package:
    - debian/patches/0list: Rename to 00list to match dpatch update.
    - debian/rules.d/dpatch.mk: Sync with Debian package with the
      following four changes:
      1) Support srcdir != builddir builds.
      2) Support $(stampdir)
      3) patch target depends on unpack
      4) Use $(DEB_SOURCE_PACKAGE) instead of $(PACKAGE)

    Remove dependency on various kernel-headers packages, bring into
    the package:
    - linux-kernel-headers/: New directory, import from 2.6.0-test2

    Add NPTL support on i386:
    - debian/sysdeps/i386.mk: Add NPTL patterns, set minimum kernel.

    Redo "DBS-Style" tarball support:
    - debian/rules.d/tarball.mk: New file
    - debian/sysdeps/linux.mk: Bring in linuxthreads and nptl overlays.
    - prep.sh: Remove.
    - version: Remove.

    - debian/patches/s390-tls.dpatch: add to build glibc 2.3.2 on s390.
      The correct fix is to modify the kernel headers, but for the present
      we use it regardless of the kernel issue.
      Patched by Gerhard Tonn <GerhardTonn@gammatau.de>.
    - debian/packages.d/libc-dev.mk: s390 kernel-headers package does not have
      generate-asm.sh.  The current libc-dev.mk assumes the existence of this
      script, but on s390 it's not existed.  Now libc-dev.mk s390 asm setup
      part does not use generate-asm.sh, and has the generate-asm.sh
      functionality in its own.  This makes s390 which has 32/64 bit multi
      libraries are much easier to build.

    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/postinst: likewise.

    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/{config,postinst,templates}: Debconf must not
      be used to store configuration items; another even more important is
      that user changes in configuration files must be preserved.
      These files are now fixed with this issue.  Patched by Denis Barbier
      <barbier@linuxfr.org>.  Some suggestions by Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>.
    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/config:
      * Replace /bin/bash by /bin/sh on the shebang line.
      * Add support for backing up.  
      * Parse configuration files and set debconf values.
    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/postinst:
      * Recreate configuration files from debconf values and run locale-gen
      * As explained by Joey Hess, this script should be safer because some
        border cases are now taken into account: configuration files might
        have no EOL at EOF, and line order is preserved.
    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/templates: 
      * Apply patch from #117509 and another typo fix by Joey Hess
        (Closes: #117509)
      * In locales/locales_to_be_generated, Choices is no more translatable

      Thanks to Jack Howarth <howarth@bromo.msbb.uc.edu>.

    - debian/libc/etc/init.d/devpts.sh: Modify mounting devpts for 2.5.68 and
      later.  As of 2.5.68, devpts is not automounted when using devfs. So
      even in that case, devpts needs to be mounted via the devpts.sh script
      as well as the case that devfs is not used.
      (Closes: #189792, #189879, #191785)

    - debian/libc/DEBIAN/postinst: Add code to remove a relic of the past

    - debian/packages.d/s390x.mk: likewise.

    - debian/patches/50_glibc232-mips-buildfix.dpatch: add for building

    - debian/patches/50_glibc23-hppa-entry.dpatch: added to fix funcptr
      (function descriptors) for _start on hppa, so we need a

  * Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>
    - debian/contron.in/sparc64: Remove the superflous (and incorrect) dep on
      gcc-3.2 for libc6-dev-sparc64. Add lib64gcc1 as a dep for libc6-sparc64.
    - Use CC for building sparc64 libs.
    - Remove build-dep for gcc-3.3 on sparc.
    - Really fix devpts.sh so that it mounts devpts whenever devpts is
      available and not mounted.
    - sparcv8-target.dpatch: New patch that enables v8 optimizations for
      sparc-linux compiles. Debian specific. For some reason config.sub
      doesn't recognize sparcv8, else I'd just pass sparcv8-linux as the host
      target.
    - Change how things are passed to configure for optimized packages, so
      that we let glibc set all the optimizations for us.
    - Change how sparc64 and s390x are built. Before the binary stage would
      force the build of the packages. Now, the build/install phases dep on
      the same for sparc64 and s390x. Same way that the OPT packages are done.

       formerly provided by libc6. Now libc6 depends on libdb1-compat,
       so upgrading from woody to sarge does not break any libdb1 issues.

    - Cleanup the config file parsing routine a bit. Make sure we open the

    correct way to handle it. In fact, it is already done according to the
    convention of the rest of the manual. The two items are tagged with the
    "GNU" comment, meaning they are GNU extensions. The libc manual explains
    in its introductory chapters that this means it needs the _GNU_SOURCE

    Thanks to Ho-seok Lee, closes: #110980, #110661
  * glibc22-fts.dpatch: Remove, fixes upstream now.
  * libc/DEBIAN/postinst: Before calling init u, make sure /proc/1/exe
    resolves to /sbin/init. This should help ensure we don't muck up
    debootstrap.  closes: #110615

glibc (2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Final release of 2.2.4. Not much changed from 2.2.3-11.
  * Remove cruft from debian/patches/

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Aug 2001 09:29:14 -0400

glibc (2.2.3-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to HEAD of CVS as of Aug 11, 2001
    - Misc fixes found in 2.2.4pre2
    - This is basically 2.2.4pre3
  * New glibc-vs-gcc3 patch, closes: #108408, #108364, #108415, #108364,
    #108454, #108476

glibc (2.2.3-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to HEAD of CVS, as of Aug 4, 2001
    - Mostly arch specific bug fixes.
    - This is actually the same as 2.2.4-pre2 (releasing in a day or so)
  * Ok, I give up. I don't want any more bug reports, so I've added the
    nfs getdents fix. If it breaks anything, I will hunt down all of those
    who submitted the patch/bug. closes: #86877
  * Added two more Q/A's to the Debian FAQ (AKA "The Overfiend Clause" :)
    This documents Debian's glibc following stable CVS, and also
    kernel-headers desync.
  * Added latex2html to build-dep-indep, closes: #101662
  * Fix tzconfig so it handles ambiguous names correctly, closes: #105580
    Patch by Martin Pool <mbp@valinux.com>
  * Add copyright and license to tzconfig, closes: #105581
  * Updated libc0.2 hurd dep to (>= 20010718-1), closes: #106291
  * Include locale-gen.8 manpage from Eduard Bloch <edi@gmx.de>
  * Duh. We don't need to cat in the saved libdb.so.3 to the new location.
    Ldconfig does the work for us by creating a symlink to it.
  * Remove sysdeps/powerpc/memset.S so ppc gets the generic C version for
    now (which is actually faster on most machines anyway), until they get
    their memset.S fixed (especially for Power3).
  * Added updates for hppa patch from Matthew Wilcox.
  * debian/rules.d/control.mk: Added hppa to list of archs for libc6

glibc (2.2.3-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really fix the timezone problem this time. I moved the UTC check
    before the TZ check, and then reuse that to get the TZ date, instead
    of the other way around. That solves the problem. Using this method, I
    can get the UTC date first setting LC_ALL=C, and then allow the
    override for the real UTC0 and $TZ date, so we get lang support
    without breakage now.

glibc (2.2.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use glibc- instead of glibc_ for the provides between libc and
    locales. Underscores are actually not allowed in package names.
  * CVS as of July 22, 2001
  * Use LC_ALL instead of LANG in libc postinst, closes: #106043, #106078,

  * Use Noninteractive, not noninteractive in postinst's, closes: #105902
  * SUPPORTED file ends in .gz...guess some people can't bother to add
    that themselves. Also, add notes about locale-gen closes: #105915
  * Fix cp -L calls, use cat instead to make sure we avoid any command
    line problems, closes: #106120, #106096
  * MIPS WARNING: The MAP_BASE_ADDR patch does not apply anymore, since it
    seems that whole bit of code was removed. MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T BREAK
    ANYTHING! :)

glibc (2.2.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS as of 7-9-2001, closes: 101308, 103251, 100398, 100398
  * New hppa patch, still not enabled by default since I got deadlocks in
    the linuxthreads tests (ex2 and ex10) on sparc.
  * Increased shlibdep to 2.2.3-7
  * SUPPORTED locales list is now in doc dir, and locale.gen is a
    non-changing file (still a conffile, but it doesn't change when glibc
    changes).
  * Fix fts patch so it doesn't break Hurd, closes: 102826
  * Make libc provide glibc_$DEBVERSION, and locales depend on it. This
    way we make sure everything matches up. closes: 100605, 100605,
    101034, 100605, 99344
  * Added some more UTF-8 locales, closes: 103742, 86372
  * Fixed hurd's ldconfig, closes: #101691
  * Already fixed ld_envlib_path, closes: 101622
  * In libc preinst, detect if we are upgrading from a version where we
    used to provide our own libdb.so.3, and keep a copy. We reuse it
    during postinst. This way, we have no time where libdb.so.3 doesn't
    exist. closes: 101795, 103586
  * Removed depends on libdb2 from libc6, since our hack above makes it
    pointless. Now, libc6 should get installed before libdb2 (since it
    depends on libc6), which will leave a working libdb.so.3. After libdb2
    is upgraded, the new libdb.so.3 will be installed, which will work
    since the new libc6 that it depends on is also working.
  * Fixed calls for zoneinfo as per JoeyH's suggestion. closes: 100461
  * Updated copyright notice since LGPL 2.1 is now used.

  * Were up to 2.2.3 now.
  * libc-dev: Conflict with older gcc's that do not have the weak-sym or
    pic-kludge patches.
  * ldd.dpatch: New and improved fix for the "no execute permissions"
    buglet. Now, ldd will not call the "file" command for every file. This
    should speed up dpkg-shlibdeps a lot.
  * Removed some obsolete db2 patches
  * Removed some other obsolete patches
  * Conflict with libnss-db that used db2
  * Depends on current libdb2 which contains libdb.so.3...hopefully this
    wont make apt choke because of a dep loop
  * Use the new gcc-3.0 to build sparc64 64bit libc/libc-dev packages.
  * Build-Depend += gcc-3.0-sparc64 [sparc]

glibc (2.2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yeah! We can disable our libdb.so.3 (db2) interface in favor of the
    one in libdb2. That package now has a symboled version so we can start
    to migrate away from this cruft. However, we do still have the db1

glibc (2.2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable building of optimized libs for now. I did not forsee the
    problems involved with symbol skew between ld-linux.so.2 and the
    optmized libc.so.6. As of now, I can see no way around this.
  * Make libc6 conflict with the optimized libs for now, so we can get rid
    of them, closes: #90753, #90758, #90763, #90770, #90778, #90779

  * Removed -O2 override for hppa, at Matt Taggart's request.
  * Build-Depend on latest gcc so we get the weak sym stuff right.
  * Made opt libs compiled specifically for 2.4.0+ kernels. This should
    make them even faster and smaller since it reduces the compatibility
    code.
  * libc-opt/DEBIAN/preinst: Check to make sure we are running under a
    2.4.0 kernel, and under the correct cpu
  * libc/DEBIAN/{prerm,postinst}: Changed check for package name to use

glibc (2.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS synced as of 2001-01-03. Happy freaking new year.
  * Remove FAKEROOT check, since we don't build locales now, we don't have
    to worry about it.
  * dlfcn/dlerror.c: dlerror(): Check for result->errstring being NULL,
    closes: #80991
  * No offense, but I cannot be expected to debug fortran programs
    compiled with a commercial(?), non-GNU compiler. Talk to them about
    getting it to work. As for the "works on RH, but not Debian", most
    likely that didn't do anything to make it very portable. closes: #68510
  * Tested with current NIS, and the test cases passes with no open fd's.
    closes: #52222
  * Make note of AMD in libc6-i[56]86 descriptions. closes: #77791
  * Make note about some commercial programs not liking our optimized
    libraries (IBM JDK for one). closes: #78656
    NOTE: To the submitter of this bugreport, I'm pretty sure the JDK
    relies on frame-pointer to handle some special ass-backwards stuff,
    which wont work with these libraries since they are compiled without
    frame-pointer (making it hard to strace, and debug using these libs).
  * Yes, semget(2) refers to SEMMSL, but nothing I can find says it should
    be defined in userspace. closes: #11560
  * This patch only applies to kernel-headers, and since they don't need
    to be used in userspace, it's ok to have some oddities, closes: #55578
  * I was able to write an 90 byte "Hello World" .c, and compile it into
    an 800 byte static binary using -nostdlib and -Wl,-lc. closes: #21676
  * Making an ar archive from one .o is just silly, closes: #58606
  * Patch sent upstream. Might change a bit, but the result should be the
    same, closes: #73003
  * I believe the reason the .pwd.lock file remains is to avoid a race
    condition, where something might be waiting for the lock, and
    unlinking it would cause something else to be able to obtain the lock,
    even though it isn't available. closes: #14093
  * I tried to reproduce this, but glob kept working right for me. I think
    the user is misusing the function. Most likely they are passing the
    glob on the command line, which is in turn doing some escape
    processing, and not working right with glob() itself. closes: #67921
  * In Debian, locales are not required to be installed. closes: #35875
  * Could not reproduce in the latest glibc. Upstream seems to have fixed
    this. closes: #75163
  * Bug report log says this is fixed in glibc 2.1.1, closes: #36775
  * I think this was an issue with the gcc-2.95 compiler defaulting to
    486 instruction sets. This was fixed by gcc some time ago. closes:
    #38998
  * The "order" directive in host.conf is supposed to be a space seperated
    list of sources, not comma. This is a bug in host.conf(5), which has
    already been reported. I'm closing this one to avoid duplication.
    closes: #35731
  * Appears to be related to #36775, but I checked the test case anyway,
    and it worked as expected. closes: #35035
  * I tried the test program, and it worked fine. So either guile or glibc
    fixed the bug already. closes: #36030
  * The locales package is not referenced by any other package ATM.
    closes: #38742
  * Symlink /usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime to /etc/localtime for libc5
    compat. closes: #48705
  * SUSv2 defines putenv as "int putenv(char *)", closes: #60960
  * From my understanding of of the SUSv2 definition, the pointer
    reference of inbuf may be incremented to the current position of
    translation. So in actuality, the object is not const. GLibc
    interprets this using the __restrict compiler option (defined in gcc's
    later than 2.92, e.g. egcs 1.1.2, and gcc 2.95). closes: #77312
  * Fixed ambiguity problem in tzconfig, closes: #69045
  * This was a netscape/libc5/plugin issue, closes: #50672

  * Ok, the 51 pages of flaming in tis bug report leads me to believe that
    this will never be resolved in glibc. IMO, it is up to the programmer
    to be smart enough to check these things (where it matters). I am
    closing this bug report on the precedence that it is not really a bug
    because current functionality meets specs (and this bug report would
    break that compatibility). This entire bug report should be archived

  * First of all, I do think tzconfig manpage needs to be in section 8.
    However, changing the execute permissions does very little. In fact it

glibc (2.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added m68k lchown fixes, plus removed conflict for libstdc++2.10-dev
    on m68k. Bug/patch provided by Michael Fedrowitz
    <michael.fedrowitz@informatik.uni-ulm.de>, closes: #78937
  * libc-opt: added memprof to the death list of packages that don't work
    with our optimized libraries, closes: #79224
  * Added Provides: glibc2.2 to libc6/libc6.1/libc0.2 so I can make
    locales dep on it, closes: #78495
  * CVS sync as of 2000-12-15
  * Fixed previously: closes: #75865, #77170, #75473
  * Added a "." counter while checking services for install, closes: #78881
  * %hhn works as expected in i386 in this version of glibc, closes: #79221
  * Looks like this is resolved, closes: #59429
  * The libc info page says not to use fgets on streams that may have NULL
    char's, which sockets might, closes: #57729
  * This is probably fixed, if not reopen it please, closes: #24414
  * Well this bug report has no report in the BTS, I am going to assume
    from the age and type of the title, that it is fixed, closes: #21272
  * Old ld.so issue, most likely resolved in hamm, closes: #46173
  * This bug is a simple programming mistake. For one the child never
  * fills the buffer in certain cases, so it's contents are never flushed.
    If the program called fflush after every output, then it works fine,
    closes: #26226
  * The new upgrade code in libc postint should resolve this, closes: #64074
  * This is a compilation error. libc.so.6 does not contains fxstat
    (libc-nonshared.a does), so if you don't link properly (like with
    gcc), you will miss some symbols, closes: #36139
  * Similar to the above, also resolved, closes: #30427
  * Old ld.so bug, fixed, closes: #70658
  * Current localedef doesn't seem to segv on improper input, closes: #65634, #64878
  * YAOLDSOB (Yet Another LDSO Bug), closes: #42944
  * Lack of useful info in the BTS ("I suspect glibc" doesn't cut it),
    closes: #36498
  * Someone needs to read release notes, closes: #41455
  * Uh, tzconfig works. Tzselect is not for changing timezones, but for
    querying what the available ones are. From tzselect(1):

      Note  that tzselect will not actually change the timezone
      for you. Use the tzconfig(8) utility to achieve this.
    
    So you see, this is how it's meant to be, closes: #37409
  * Fixed in glibc 2.2, closes: #42512
  * a) all init scripts need to support restart
    b) postinst uses stop/start now anyway
    c) postinst fails much better now when things go wrong

    closes: #52914
  * getaddrinfo does DNS lookups regardless because of the nature of the
    function. Also it handles ipv4/ipv6 better now, closes: #60743
  * I don't see why libc6 needs to create /etc/rcS.d/ when dpkg does it so
    closes: #66138
  * strstr seems pretty fast now, closes: #10689
  * Latest emacs/libc6 is working fine, closes: #48476
  * YAOLDSOB, closes: #42135
  * libstdc++-v3/glibc2.2 compiles fine together, closes: #66757
  * strerror() with maxerror+1 works as expected now, closes: #40184
  * No other info, and no similar reports. Assuming user error, closes: #31465
  * Old ssh-nonfree getting a sigsegv is not a bug in libc6, but sshd,
    closes: #41800
  * Restarting woffle already, closes: #74164
  * I believe this was due to some old nss1 issues, which are now resolved
    during upgrades, closes: #35089
  * This is something libc6 itself cannot fix. Either way, rsh/rlogin is
    broken by nature, closes: #19168
  * Well, I can't retroactively go back to hamm and add a stub for
    setresuid(), closes: #29675
  * Fixed upstream a long time ago, closes: #39693
  * From unix/getlogin.c:

    /* Get name of tty connected to fd 0.  Return NULL if not a tty or
       if fd 0 isn't open.  Note that a lot of documentation says that
       getlogin() is based on the controlling terminal---what they
       really mean is "the terminal connected to standard input".  The
       getlogin() implementation of DEC Unix, SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX all
       return NULL if fd 0 has been closed, so this is the compatible
       thing to do.  Note that ttyname(open("/dev/tty")) on those
       systems returns /dev/tty, so that is not a possible solution for
       getlogin().  */

    So basically, closes: #17528
  * Current nis/nss-compat code looks like it handles this right,
    closes: #33197
  * libc6 cannot compensate for broken coding, closes: #42912
  * nprocs is fixed in 2.2, closes: #57101
  * libdb.so.2 does have shlibs now, closes: #39578
  * getcwd now returns NULL in the case shown in this bug report, so there
    is no suprise if the program checks the return correctly, closes:
    #27227
  * Adduser now restarts nscd as needed, closes: #37296
  * getaddrinfo fixes for ipv4/ipv6 fixes this, closes: #58713
  * Programs using libc5/libc6 at the same time via dynamically loading
    libc5 apps from a libc6 apps) simply does not work, closes: #42088
  * getaddrinfo fix, closes: #70012
  * libc-64 was never meant to work right, closes: #53748
  * libNoVersion.so.1 is gone, closes: #37681
  * libc/postinst is file-rc friendly now, closes: #40053

  * llseek is obsolete, use lseek64 now, closes: #20988
  * Actually this looks like an error in the program, closes: #41952
  * Hmm, I would guess that libc6/libc5.4.38 is correct, and libc5.4.17 is
    wrong, close: #21839
  * Fixed in the Before Time, during the Great Long-Long Ago,
    closes: #39585, #34442, #59622, #24652

    - Includes hppa config stuff
  * Ok, libsafe seems to be broken with our optimized packages. I
    reassigned the bug report to that package. Most likely this wont be
    fixed in libsafe for a bit, so for now I am making the optimized
    packages conflict with it. The likely cause is the inline string

    Debian-Rough-Ride, Xfree86-4.0.1, which is currently in progress.
  * glibc22-ipv6-USAGI.dpatch: New patch, brings some stability and

glibc (2.1.94-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated CVS post-2.1.94 to 20000929
  * Put db/db2 libs back in for runtime use only (not linkable and no
    headers). Closes a shitload of bugs, and makes everyone happy. Oh, let
    the sun shine down.
  * alpha-dwarf2-dl-machine: merged upstream
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: removed all the db2 cruft conflicts
  * debian/libc/DEBIAN/postinst: Use /etc/rc${rl}.d/ instead of
    /etc/init.d/ when restarting services. This way, we don't start any
    services that were meant to be off. Also, check for a non-zero exit when
    starting and report such failures. This will give people a heads up to
    any problems.

glibc (2.1.94-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed WANT_LDD, we now install it for every arch. This removes the
    need for the ldso package completely, on systems without libc5 (YAH!)
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.mk: removed cruft
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: new script with a simplified control deps
    setup to replace depflags.mk. The former was getting too complex
  * debian/rules.d/shlibs.mk: fixed logic preventing it from actually
    installing the new shlibs file
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: Added lots of conflicts for NMU'd packages
    that fell prey to the db2 problems.
  * debian/contron.in/main: Fix nscd depend on libc6

glibc (2.1.94-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer, "Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice"
  * New upstream version, pre 2.2 now
    - crypt is now in glibc source, so is not a seperate tarball
    - removed nss1 compat tarball
    - db2 is gone aswell
    - without db2, upstream split nss_db from main source (*sigh*)
  * Added inetd to list of services to restart
  * modfl/fmodl: documented in info pages, closes: #17874
  * Just a quick list of bugs that I can verify do not exist any longer,
    closes: #45903, #26514, #46547, #32345, #30987, #48713
  * fcloseall: in the case of stdio/fcloseall.c, yes, it only ever
    returns success. However, we use libio/fcloseall.c, who does in fact
    have a chance to return EOF, closes: #20973
  * libio/libio.h: shows that the Stream Hooks do in fact take (void *) as
    the first argument as shown in the protos, closes: #61497
  * trunc/floor: documented correctly in this release, closes: #65683, #65684
  * Hurd maintainers say this can be closed, closes: #54154
  * I'm pretty sure this isn't an issue anymore, else potato wouldn't be
    releasing, closes: #35049
  * Sorry this isn't a glibc bug. The kernel handles error returns on a
    failed executable. Most likely this is bin_interp's problem, but I
    seriously doubt it will be fixed because of conventions, standards and
    the like, closes: #22301
  * keyenvoy: no longer compiled for linux (it seems), closes: #47560
  * infnan: is defined now, closes: #19264
  * libc5 bug, no longer applies, closes: #11300
  * Make sure we copy over asm-sparc for sparc aswell as "generate-asm.sh"
    script used to generate /usr/include/asm
  * Disable parallel build on sparc (broken for some reason, might not be
    sparc specific)
  * devpts.sh: used a more devfs friendly version from bug submitter,
    closes: #65276
  * libc/postinst: cannot reproduce problem, appears to be user error,
    closes: #64865
  * glibc-doc: this bug is no longer valid, closes: #33759
  * We now use ldconfig from libc6 for all archs, ldso will conform.
  * Change build deps to just "kernel-headers" for non-Hurd archs. With
    mips and other coming down the pipe, this is bound to get ugly if we
    specify the particular version for each.
  * Add checks to automatically detect proper kernel-headers, error out
    otherwise.
  * hurd: add Depends: hurd (>= 20000803) for libc0.2
  * libpthread: soname version is now 0.9
  * debian/libc/DEBIAN/shlibs: bump to 2.1.94
  * libc6: add temporary depend on libdb2
  * debian/rules: check for FAKEROOTKEY, and fail if it's there. We cannot
    build under fakeroot, we need real rewt. Fear my hacking skillz.
