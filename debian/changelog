      - glibc23-cmov.dpatch: Drop additional TLS parts.
      - glibc23-sse-oldkernel.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - hppa-drop-utimes.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - ldconfig.dpatch: The previous patch seems being wrong because it
        supresses all warnings about error.  The new patch I introduced should
        not warn during debootstrap, and works finely during normal operation.
      - ldd.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - ldso-disable-hwcap.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - locale-no_NO.dpatch: Drop locale.alias part which is already applied.
      - makeconfig.dpatch: Regenerated.
      - 50_glibc232-arm-dwarf2-buildfix.dpatch: Modify to fix sjlj compilation.
      - 50_glibc232-m68k-dwarf2-buildfix.dpatch: Likewise.

    * These dpatches are currently suspended to apply (those entries in
      00list are commented out) with various reasons, they need update or
      confirmation:
      - 30_glibc232-base.dpatch: If this patch is needed, the another
        binutils related problem should be occured.  It's disabled for a
        while, then remove iff no problem is reported.
      - alpha-pic.dpatch: #175511 said the upstream should have another 
        different fix.  After confirmation, it should be removed.
      - arm-output-format.dpatch: I believe the recent arm glibc should work
        without this patch.  If arm still has problem, then enable it.
      - glibc232-globfree-clear.dpatch: The latest upstream has gl_pathv=NULL 
        part, bug gl_pathc=0 part.  I think the current code is harmless.
        It needs confirmation to Jeff Licquia.
      - translation-fr.dpatch: The upstream rejects this wishlist bug.  After 
        confirmation, it'll be removed.
      - mips-asm-unistd.dpatch: I need to look at the result of the current cvs
        unistd.h.
      - hurd-enable-ldconfig.dpatch: Disabled currently.

    * These dpatches are currently applied, but it may be removed from
      00list as until sarge stuff:
      - libgcc-compat-all.dpatch: It'll be removed in future.
      - libgcc-compat-other.dpatch: Likewise.

    * These dpatches are currently suspended to apply from 00list because
      we plan to be removed after sarge release:
      - glibc23-ctype-compat.dpatch: Until sarge stuff.
      - glibc23-errno-hack.dpatch: Until sarge stuff.
      - glibc23-errno.dpatch: This patch should not be considered permanent;
        it may be one of until sarge stuff.
      - glibc23-function-compat.dpatch: Until sarge stuff.
      - locales-supported.dpatch: Debian specific, until sarge stuff.

     - debian/patches/ubuntu-altlocaledir.dpatch: Revert new time
       comparison result caching from 2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu11 since this
       breaks if applications use several translation domains from both
       /usr/share/locale and /usr/share/locale-langpack/. Now just avoid

  * Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>

     - debian/debhelper.in/locales.config:  Be careful to set
       LC_COLLATE=C while sorting locale lists.
       Sort/uniq locales read from locale.gen to avoid duplicate
       locales reproducing indefinitely.
       Avoid generating multiple identical UTF-8 locales for similar
       legacy locales.
       Write user-visible messages to stderr, not stdout; the latter
       belongs to debconf.

    - debian/debhelper.in/*: Use debhelper for all package management.
    - debian/rules.d/*: Split out rules file into logical pieces.
    - debian/local/*: Move all of the files that Debian provides to here.

    Update dpatch to more closely match the debian package:

      2) Support $(stampdir)
      3) patch target depends on unpack
      4) Use $(DEB_SOURCE_PACKAGE) instead of $(PACKAGE)

    Remove dependency on various kernel-headers packages, bring into
    the package:
    - linux-kernel-headers/: New directory, import from 2.6.0-test2

    Add NPTL support on i386:

    - debian/patches/s390-tls.dpatch: add to build glibc 2.3.2 on s390.
      The correct fix is to modify the kernel headers, but for the present
      we use it regardless of the kernel issue.
      Patched by Gerhard Tonn <GerhardTonn@gammatau.de>.
    - debian/packages.d/libc-dev.mk: s390 kernel-headers package does not have
      generate-asm.sh.  The current libc-dev.mk assumes the existence of this
      script, but on s390 it's not existed.  Now libc-dev.mk s390 asm setup
      part does not use generate-asm.sh, and has the generate-asm.sh
      functionality in its own.  This makes s390 which has 32/64 bit multi
      libraries are much easier to build.
      Patched by Gerhard Tonn <GerhardTonn@gammatau.de>.

      deleted when /etc/locale/gen is not managaed by debconf. Patched by

    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/postinst: likewise.

    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/{config,postinst,templates}: Debconf must not
      be used to store configuration items; another even more important is
      that user changes in configuration files must be preserved.
      These files are now fixed with this issue.  Patched by Denis Barbier
      <barbier@linuxfr.org>.  Some suggestions by Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>.
    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/config:
      * Replace /bin/bash by /bin/sh on the shebang line.
      * Add support for backing up.  
      * Parse configuration files and set debconf values.
    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/postinst:
      * Recreate configuration files from debconf values and run locale-gen
      * As explained by Joey Hess, this script should be safer because some
        border cases are now taken into account: configuration files might
        have no EOL at EOF, and line order is preserved.
    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/templates: 
      * Apply patch from #117509 and another typo fix by Joey Hess

      change in 2003-04-02 to be enable to compile librt.so for the present.
      And this bug is fixed during the development, this patch is dropped now.
      Thanks to Jack Howarth <howarth@bromo.msbb.uc.edu>.

    - debian/libc/etc/init.d/devpts.sh: Modify mounting devpts for 2.5.68 and
      later.  As of 2.5.68, devpts is not automounted when using devfs. So
      even in that case, devpts needs to be mounted via the devpts.sh script
      as well as the case that devfs is not used.
      (Closes: #189792, #189879, #191785)

    - debian/libc/DEBIAN/postinst: Add code to remove a relic of the past
      /usr/doc/<package> symlinks.  This script should keep at least until

      Patched by Randolph Chung <tausq@debian.org>.  (Closes: #193656)

  * Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>
    - debian/contron.in/sparc64: Remove the superflous (and incorrect) dep on
      gcc-3.2 for libc6-dev-sparc64. Add lib64gcc1 as a dep for libc6-sparc64.
    - Use CC for building sparc64 libs.
    - Remove build-dep for gcc-3.3 on sparc.
    - Really fix devpts.sh so that it mounts devpts whenever devpts is
      available and not mounted.
    - sparcv8-target.dpatch: New patch that enables v8 optimizations for
      sparc-linux compiles. Debian specific. For some reason config.sub
      doesn't recognize sparcv8, else I'd just pass sparcv8-linux as the host
      target.
    - Change how things are passed to configure for optimized packages, so
      that we let glibc set all the optimizations for us.
    - Change how sparc64 and s390x are built. Before the binary stage would
      force the build of the packages. Now, the build/install phases dep on
      the same for sparc64 and s390x. Same way that the OPT packages are done.

      relased apparently. (Closes: #165358, #173201)

    - debian/locales/DEBIAN/config: db_set is set if and only if locale.gen
      is existed.  Patched by Masato Taruishi <taru@debian.org>
      His note:
       The previous config script always set locales_to_be_generated
       even when /etc/locale.gen doesn't exist. So the question in
       dpkg-preconfigure time became empty in dpkg --configure locales time. 
       This change resolves long outstanding locales bug.

       libdb1 support is removed. libdb1-compat contains libdb1 which is
       formerly provided by libc6. Now libc6 depends on libdb1-compat,

      (hurd-i386 only)
    - Prune hurd-ldflags from Hurd patch list.  Noone is quite sure what
      it's for.  With this change, all hurd-i386 patches are now upstream
      in CVS.
    - Add 'mathpatch' to fix a math testsuite failure.

glibc (2.2.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added patch from Ulrich to really fix the [x-] fnmatch() case.
    Closes: #96013
  * Updated gcc3 compat patch.
  * Several changes to ldconfig:
    - Parse the config file before checking system directories. This is needed
      to make sure it is possible to override system directories.
    - Cleanup the config file parsing routine a bit. Make sure we open the
    config file with correct perms in case it gets created by this call.
  * Pulled from CVS as of Oct 27, 2001:
    - Includes fnmatch fix upstream.
    - strxfrm fix.
    - dlfcn fix for C++ program usage.
    - ENABLE_NLS fixes for various functions (doesn't affect us, since it is
      mainly meant for non-nls builds).
    - IPv6 reverse lookup fixes.
    - Lots of libm fixes.
    - Several language translation updates.
    - Several m68k setjmp fixes.
    - Some mips fixes merged.

  * Fixup ttyname patch for devfs, which broke some things. Closes: #117551
  * Remove the errno.texi explanation for _GNU_SOURCE for two defines. The
    thing is, according to the libc manual conventions, this is not the
    correct way to handle it. In fact, it is already done according to the
    convention of the rest of the manual. The two items are tagged with the
    "GNU" comment, meaning they are GNU extensions. The libc manual explains
    in its introductory chapters that this means it needs the _GNU_SOURCE
    define.

  * Really fix the timezone problem this time. I moved the UTC check
    before the TZ check, and then reuse that to get the TZ date, instead
    of the other way around. That solves the problem. Using this method, I
    can get the UTC date first setting LC_ALL=C, and then allow the
    override for the real UTC0 and $TZ date, so we get lang support

  * Increased shlibdep to 2.2.3-7
  * SUPPORTED locales list is now in doc dir, and locale.gen is a

    changes).
  * Fix fts patch so it doesn't break Hurd, closes: 102826

  * Fixed hurd's ldconfig, closes: #101691
  * Already fixed ld_envlib_path, closes: 101622
  * In libc preinst, detect if we are upgrading from a version where we
    used to provide our own libdb.so.3, and keep a copy. We reuse it
    during postinst. This way, we have no time where libdb.so.3 doesn't
    exist. closes: 101795, 103586
  * Removed depends on libdb2 from libc6, since our hack above makes it
    pointless. Now, libc6 should get installed before libdb2 (since it
    depends on libc6), which will leave a working libdb.so.3. After libdb2
    is upgraded, the new libdb.so.3 will be installed, which will work
    since the new libc6 that it depends on is also working.
  * Fixed calls for zoneinfo as per JoeyH's suggestion. closes: 100461

glibc (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Were up to 2.2.3 now.
  * libc-dev: Conflict with older gcc's that do not have the weak-sym or
    pic-kludge patches.
  * ldd.dpatch: New and improved fix for the "no execute permissions"
    buglet. Now, ldd will not call the "file" command for every file. This
    should speed up dpkg-shlibdeps a lot.
  * Removed some obsolete db2 patches
  * Removed some other obsolete patches
  * Conflict with libnss-db that used db2
  * Depends on current libdb2 which contains libdb.so.3...hopefully this
    wont make apt choke because of a dep loop
  * Use the new gcc-3.0 to build sparc64 64bit libc/libc-dev packages.
  * Build-Depend += gcc-3.0-sparc64 [sparc]

glibc (2.2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yeah! We can disable our libdb.so.3 (db2) interface in favor of the
    one in libdb2. That package now has a symboled version so we can start
    to migrate away from this cruft. However, we do still have the db1
    support.

glibc (2.2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable building of optimized libs for now. I did not forsee the
    problems involved with symbol skew between ld-linux.so.2 and the
    optmized libc.so.6. As of now, I can see no way around this.
  * Make libc6 conflict with the optimized libs for now, so we can get rid
    of them, closes: #90753, #90758, #90763, #90770, #90778, #90779
  * RPC patch from Jakub Jelenik, probably closes: #90830
  * Add build-dep for file, m4 not needed now that opt libs are gone.
    closes: #90773

  * Check to make sure any services actually need to be restarted, closes:
    #88440
  * Conflict with old strace, which appears to break under new libc6,
    closes: #88775
  * Make sure we remove any CVS cruft, closes: #90173
  * Removed -O2 override for hppa, at Matt Taggart's request.
  * Build-Depend on latest gcc so we get the weak sym stuff right.
  * Made opt libs compiled specifically for 2.4.0+ kernels. This should
    make them even faster and smaller since it reduces the compatibility
    code.
  * libc-opt/DEBIAN/preinst: Check to make sure we are running under a
    2.4.0 kernel, and under the correct cpu
  * libc/DEBIAN/{prerm,postinst}: Changed check for package name to use
    basename of $0 as opposed to uname.

glibc (2.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS synced as of 2001-01-03. Happy freaking new year.
  * Remove FAKEROOT check, since we don't build locales now, we don't have
    to worry about it.
  * dlfcn/dlerror.c: dlerror(): Check for result->errstring being NULL,
    closes: #80991
  * No offense, but I cannot be expected to debug fortran programs
    compiled with a commercial(?), non-GNU compiler. Talk to them about
    getting it to work. As for the "works on RH, but not Debian", most
    likely that didn't do anything to make it very portable. closes: #68510
  * Tested with current NIS, and the test cases passes with no open fd's.
    closes: #52222
  * Make note of AMD in libc6-i[56]86 descriptions. closes: #77791
  * Make note about some commercial programs not liking our optimized
    libraries (IBM JDK for one). closes: #78656
    NOTE: To the submitter of this bugreport, I'm pretty sure the JDK
    relies on frame-pointer to handle some special ass-backwards stuff,
    which wont work with these libraries since they are compiled without
    frame-pointer (making it hard to strace, and debug using these libs).
  * Yes, semget(2) refers to SEMMSL, but nothing I can find says it should
    be defined in userspace. closes: #11560
  * This patch only applies to kernel-headers, and since they don't need
    to be used in userspace, it's ok to have some oddities, closes: #55578
  * I was able to write an 90 byte "Hello World" .c, and compile it into
    an 800 byte static binary using -nostdlib and -Wl,-lc. closes: #21676
  * Making an ar archive from one .o is just silly, closes: #58606
  * Patch sent upstream. Might change a bit, but the result should be the
    same, closes: #73003
  * I believe the reason the .pwd.lock file remains is to avoid a race
    condition, where something might be waiting for the lock, and
    unlinking it would cause something else to be able to obtain the lock,
    even though it isn't available. closes: #14093
  * I tried to reproduce this, but glob kept working right for me. I think
    the user is misusing the function. Most likely they are passing the
    glob on the command line, which is in turn doing some escape
    processing, and not working right with glob() itself. closes: #67921
  * In Debian, locales are not required to be installed. closes: #35875
  * Could not reproduce in the latest glibc. Upstream seems to have fixed
    this. closes: #75163
  * Bug report log says this is fixed in glibc 2.1.1, closes: #36775
  * I think this was an issue with the gcc-2.95 compiler defaulting to
    486 instruction sets. This was fixed by gcc some time ago. closes:
    #38998
  * The "order" directive in host.conf is supposed to be a space seperated
    list of sources, not comma. This is a bug in host.conf(5), which has
    already been reported. I'm closing this one to avoid duplication.
    closes: #35731
  * Appears to be related to #36775, but I checked the test case anyway,
    and it worked as expected. closes: #35035
  * I tried the test program, and it worked fine. So either guile or glibc
    fixed the bug already. closes: #36030
  * The locales package is not referenced by any other package ATM.
    closes: #38742
  * Symlink /usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime to /etc/localtime for libc5
    compat. closes: #48705
  * SUSv2 defines putenv as "int putenv(char *)", closes: #60960
  * From my understanding of of the SUSv2 definition, the pointer
    reference of inbuf may be incremented to the current position of
    translation. So in actuality, the object is not const. GLibc
    interprets this using the __restrict compiler option (defined in gcc's
    later than 2.92, e.g. egcs 1.1.2, and gcc 2.95). closes: #77312
  * Fixed ambiguity problem in tzconfig, closes: #69045
  * This was a netscape/libc5/plugin issue, closes: #50672
  * User error. He is setting all of the fd's in the pollfd struct to -1,
    which returns POLLNVAL, which is the expected response. closes: #51877
  * objstack_* does use const definitions now, closes: #68918
  * This was the old xmms-segv's-on-exit bug, fixed by glibc 2.1.9X (can't
    remember which version exactly). closes: #74345
  * leading zero makes sscanf determine the number as an octal, closes:
    #69278
  * zic.8: zdump is section 1, not 8. closes: #72095
  * Old libdb2 upgrade issue, fixed in during the 2.1.9x uploads. closes:
    #72663
  * Update this changelog to include the revisions from the stable (potato)
    updates.
  * Patch sent upstream. Fixes timezone showing up as "/etc/localtime".

    closing this bug report on the precedence that it is not really a bug

    <michael.fedrowitz@informatik.uni-ulm.de>, closes: #78937
  * libc-opt: added memprof to the death list of packages that don't work
    with our optimized libraries, closes: #79224
  * Added Provides: glibc2.2 to libc6/libc6.1/libc0.2 so I can make
    locales dep on it, closes: #78495
  * CVS sync as of 2000-12-15
  * Fixed previously: closes: #75865, #77170, #75473
  * Added a "." counter while checking services for install, closes: #78881
  * %hhn works as expected in i386 in this version of glibc, closes: #79221
  * Looks like this is resolved, closes: #59429
  * The libc info page says not to use fgets on streams that may have NULL
    char's, which sockets might, closes: #57729
  * This is probably fixed, if not reopen it please, closes: #24414
  * Well this bug report has no report in the BTS, I am going to assume
    from the age and type of the title, that it is fixed, closes: #21272
  * Old ld.so issue, most likely resolved in hamm, closes: #46173
  * This bug is a simple programming mistake. For one the child never
  * fills the buffer in certain cases, so it's contents are never flushed.
    If the program called fflush after every output, then it works fine,
    closes: #26226
  * The new upgrade code in libc postint should resolve this, closes: #64074
  * This is a compilation error. libc.so.6 does not contains fxstat
    (libc-nonshared.a does), so if you don't link properly (like with
    gcc), you will miss some symbols, closes: #36139
  * Similar to the above, also resolved, closes: #30427
  * Old ld.so bug, fixed, closes: #70658
  * Current localedef doesn't seem to segv on improper input, closes: #65634, #64878
  * YAOLDSOB (Yet Another LDSO Bug), closes: #42944
  * Lack of useful info in the BTS ("I suspect glibc" doesn't cut it),
    closes: #36498
  * Someone needs to read release notes, closes: #41455
  * Uh, tzconfig works. Tzselect is not for changing timezones, but for
    querying what the available ones are. From tzselect(1):

      Note  that tzselect will not actually change the timezone
      for you. Use the tzconfig(8) utility to achieve this.
    
    So you see, this is how it's meant to be, closes: #37409
  * Fixed in glibc 2.2, closes: #42512
  * a) all init scripts need to support restart
    b) postinst uses stop/start now anyway
    c) postinst fails much better now when things go wrong

    closes: #52914
  * getaddrinfo does DNS lookups regardless because of the nature of the
    function. Also it handles ipv4/ipv6 better now, closes: #60743
  * I don't see why libc6 needs to create /etc/rcS.d/ when dpkg does it so
    closes: #66138
  * strstr seems pretty fast now, closes: #10689
  * Latest emacs/libc6 is working fine, closes: #48476
  * YAOLDSOB, closes: #42135
  * libstdc++-v3/glibc2.2 compiles fine together, closes: #66757
  * strerror() with maxerror+1 works as expected now, closes: #40184
  * No other info, and no similar reports. Assuming user error, closes: #31465
  * Old ssh-nonfree getting a sigsegv is not a bug in libc6, but sshd,
    closes: #41800
  * Restarting woffle already, closes: #74164
  * I believe this was due to some old nss1 issues, which are now resolved
    during upgrades, closes: #35089
  * This is something libc6 itself cannot fix. Either way, rsh/rlogin is
    broken by nature, closes: #19168
  * Well, I can't retroactively go back to hamm and add a stub for
    setresuid(), closes: #29675
  * Fixed upstream a long time ago, closes: #39693
  * From unix/getlogin.c:

    /* Get name of tty connected to fd 0.  Return NULL if not a tty or
       if fd 0 isn't open.  Note that a lot of documentation says that
       getlogin() is based on the controlling terminal---what they
       really mean is "the terminal connected to standard input".  The
       getlogin() implementation of DEC Unix, SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX all
       return NULL if fd 0 has been closed, so this is the compatible
       thing to do.  Note that ttyname(open("/dev/tty")) on those
       systems returns /dev/tty, so that is not a possible solution for
       getlogin().  */

    So basically, closes: #17528
  * Current nis/nss-compat code looks like it handles this right,
    closes: #33197
  * libc6 cannot compensate for broken coding, closes: #42912
  * nprocs is fixed in 2.2, closes: #57101
  * libdb.so.2 does have shlibs now, closes: #39578
  * getcwd now returns NULL in the case shown in this bug report, so there
    is no suprise if the program checks the return correctly, closes:
    #27227
  * Adduser now restarts nscd as needed, closes: #37296
  * getaddrinfo fixes for ipv4/ipv6 fixes this, closes: #58713
  * Programs using libc5/libc6 at the same time via dynamically loading
    libc5 apps from a libc6 apps) simply does not work, closes: #42088
  * getaddrinfo fix, closes: #70012
  * libc-64 was never meant to work right, closes: #53748
  * libNoVersion.so.1 is gone, closes: #37681
  * libc/postinst is file-rc friendly now, closes: #40053
  * libdb2 is no longer a reference for libdb stuff, closes: #61154
  * ld.so/ldconfig now have man pages, closes: #41917
  * Bah, libtricks is old and gone, closes: #39080
  * /var/state/glibc is gone, closes: #39562, #39705
  * glibc no longer includes db/db2, so look for docs in those seperate
    packages, closes: #23547
  * scsi/scsi.h is there, closes: #31502
  * linux/joystick.h is there, closes: #38028
  * db.h is no longer in libc6-dev, closes: #39077, #74945
  * nprocs works on sparc now, closes: #52420
  * ldd now supports libc5 better, closes: #35644
  * Unreproducable, closes: #39582, #25773, #35624, #35123
  * /var/lib/misc/Makefile does not refer to /var/db, closes: #41947
  * llseek is obsolete, use lseek64 now, closes: #20988
  * Actually this looks like an error in the program, closes: #41952
  * Hmm, I would guess that libc6/libc5.4.38 is correct, and libc5.4.17 is
    wrong, close: #21839
  * Fixed in the Before Time, during the Great Long-Long Ago,
    closes: #39585, #34442, #59622, #24652
  * That's all for now...

glibc (2.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to CVS as of 2000-11-27
    - Includes hppa config stuff
  * Ok, libsafe seems to be broken with our optimized packages. I
    reassigned the bug report to that package. Most likely this wont be
    fixed in libsafe for a bit, so for now I am making the optimized
    packages conflict with it. The likely cause is the inline string
    functions (-D__USE_STRING_INLINES).
  * libc/postinst: added lprng and lpr to the list of daemons to restart,
    closes: #78132

glibc (2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dear god! Who changed things to a symlink in the kernel-headers and
    didn't tell me of all people!? This must be a conspiracy! Some one is
    out to get me! Everyone, I am going to go underground until the
    security of my system is safe once again! (btw, I fixed the asm
    include problem before I took a vacation from my sanity...)

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Nov 2000 18:19:24 -0500

glibc (2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Damn, really remove libc6 dep from locales this time
  * Include shlibs file with optimized libs, so dpkg-shlibdeps will be
    happy with people using them.
  * Added updates eo_EO locale

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Nov 2000 15:40:12 -0500

glibc (2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to CVS to 2000-11-19
    - Includes the ldconfig patch, so removed from local set
    - WOOHOO! Includes a patch to getaddrinfo, so that it only returns
      failure if both ipv4 AND ipv6 lookups fail for PF_UNSPEC.
      closes: #72764, #72905, #74692, #74692, #74367, #75388, #74692
    - Now includes the USAGI ipv6 patch
  * control/locales: remove $(libc) dep...bad for a arch-all package,
    closes: #76830
  * Move locales to binary-indep targets, closes: #76830
  * Add another hppa patch for _setjmp. Also, make hppa build with -O for
    now.
  * libc-dbg: make debug/ld*.so executable
  * $(libc): suggests libnss-db
  * locale-gen: set umask to 022, closes: #77191
  * etc/locale.gen: uncomment en_US as a default
  * debian/sysdeps/optimized.mk: New make snippet, which allows building
    optimized sets of runtime libraries. Right now, only sparc and i386
    seem to support hwcap, so we only build i586, i686 and v9 optimized
    libraries. When other archs start supporting hwcap, then they too can
    join the club.
  * prep.sh: use ./version, so ash will work too
  * Fixed prior to this release: closes: #71938, #75295, #75488, #76168

glibc (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * ALL HAIL GLIBC 2.2 RELEASE! Please put seats in full upright position,
    remain seated until installed, and do not panic. The ride is almost
    over. Once you have installed Glibc 2.2, please procede to our new
    Debian-Rough-Ride, Xfree86-4.0.1, which is currently in progress.
  * glibc22-ipv6-USAGI.dpatch: New patch, brings some stability and
    compatibility to ipv6. This will most likely fix ipv6 issues with
    things like ssh (let me know).
  * Totally whack job on the locales package! We now do not provide *any*
    precompiled locales. Instead we allow the admin to selectively decide
    which ones to compile.
  * Start of support for future upgrades. A new patch that should make
    upgrades easier, post woody. This deals soley with the NSS module
    problem and daemons running during upgrade.
  * glibc22-hppa-config-fix: Fix config.{sub,guess} so hppa builds (From
    the nice Debian folks at HP). BTW, where's my HP/PA BOX!? :)
  * glibc22-ldconfig-fix: Fix bad allocation in ldconfig
  * Bugs closed by this release: closes: #74057, #74362, #74692, #75249,

    - fixes fmemopen issues
    - adds ja_JP.ujis alias, closes: #72686
    - fixes for sparc mathinline.h
    - lots of locale related updates
    - mips patches are now included upstream
  * depflags.pl: added replaces ldso for libc6 too (ldd), closes: #76126
  * Set --enable-kernel for Linux builds, so we can control how much
    backward compatibility we have.
  * Fix build-depends for gcc to include epoch
  * Up'd the shlibs deps to 2.1.97
  * Removed static nss

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Nov 2000 14:04:36 -0500

glibc (2.1.96-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (close to a final 2.2), closes: #73058
    - fixes ld.so reference counting (fixes some obscure bugs with
      loadable modules, like NSS).
    - fixes for ppc
    - netinet/tcp.h fixes for uint8, closes: #74061
    - fixes limits.h/LONG_MAX declerations, closes: #75720
  * When running "$(MAKE) test" use -k so we complete as much as possible
  * db/Makefile: remove patch that inhibited the db1 headers. Now, db1
    applications can be built again. This is temporary, to give poeple
    time to migrate (db2 maintainer can use this for db_dump185),
    closes: #72723
  * shlibs.mk: Use $(objdir)/soversions.i for generating the shlibs file,
    which is more correct. Thanks to Marcus Brinkman for pointing this
    out, closes: #75685
  * debian/glibc-doc/usr/share/doc-base/linuxthreads-faq: removed, no
    longer in upstream source, closes: #74046
  * libc/postinst: added wu-ftpd, wu-ftpd-academ, slapd, openldapd and
    logind to list of daemons to to restart, closes: #74158
  * libc/postinst: added support for filerc, thanks to Roland Rosenfeld
    <roland@debian.org>, closes: #74290
  * libc/postinst: check for existence of /sbin/init before restarting it,
    closes: #75310
  * sysdeps/depflags.pl: Change g++ conflict to libstdc++-dev so we
    precludes the right package (i.e., we need a newer libstdc++-dev, not a
    new g++), closes: #75019
  * sysdeps/depflags.pl: make libc6 depend on libdb2 from woody so we
    don't make apt act all weird with a three layer dependency of sorts
    (ask Jason, I'm not sure of all the issues, but it seems it is needed
    for now), closes: #75601, #75689
  * sysdeps/generic/lockf.c: explicitly set l_type to F_RDLCK (help from
    Anton on this one)
  * dl-machine.h.mips-2: new patch from Florian Lohoff <flo@rfc822.org> to
    fix ld.so segv on mips (I expect to see some .deb's in the official
    archive soon, my Indy is getting jealous :)

glibc (2.1.95-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: Don't conflict/replace old libdb2, just
    conflict.
  * debian/libc/DEBIAN/postinst: Don't just check the service name with
    "dpkg -s" since we miss things like inetd, which isn't in a package
    named "inetd". Check for "installed" and "", then -x of the init.d
    file
  * debian/patches/ldd.dpatch: fixup so we don't get double output of
    libraries, closes: #72710
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: Hmm...where did the libnss-db dep go
    anyway? There now.
  * debian/manpages/: Added man pages for ldd, ldconfig and ld.so
    to replace the ones removed from ld.so, closes: #72648, #72727
  * locales fixed in -2, closes: #72752

glibc (2.1.94-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated CVS post-2.1.94 to 20000929
  * Put db/db2 libs back in for runtime use only (not linkable and no
    headers). Closes a shitload of bugs, and makes everyone happy. Oh, let
    the sun shine down.
  * alpha-dwarf2-dl-machine: merged upstream
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: removed all the db2 cruft conflicts
  * debian/libc/DEBIAN/postinst: Use /etc/rc${rl}.d/ instead of
    /etc/init.d/ when restarting services. This way, we don't start any
    services that were meant to be off. Also, check for a non-zero exit when
    starting and report such failures. This will give people a heads up to
    any problems.

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Sep 2000 16:29:59 -0400

glibc (2.1.94-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed WANT_LDD, we now install it for every arch. This removes the
    need for the ldso package completely, on systems without libc5 (YAH!)
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.mk: removed cruft
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: new script with a simplified control deps
    setup to replace depflags.mk. The former was getting too complex
  * debian/rules.d/shlibs.mk: fixed logic preventing it from actually
    installing the new shlibs file
  * debian/sysdeps/depflags.pl: Added lots of conflicts for NMU'd packages
    that fell prey to the db2 problems.
  * debian/contron.in/main: Fix nscd depend on libc6

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Sep 2000 10:09:51 -0400

  * New upstream version, pre 2.2 now
    - crypt is now in glibc source, so is not a seperate tarball
    - removed nss1 compat tarball
    - db2 is gone aswell
    - without db2, upstream split nss_db from main source (*sigh*)
  * Added inetd to list of services to restart
  * modfl/fmodl: documented in info pages, closes: #17874
  * Just a quick list of bugs that I can verify do not exist any longer,
    closes: #45903, #26514, #46547, #32345, #30987, #48713
  * fcloseall: in the case of stdio/fcloseall.c, yes, it only ever
    returns success. However, we use libio/fcloseall.c, who does in fact
    have a chance to return EOF, closes: #20973
  * libio/libio.h: shows that the Stream Hooks do in fact take (void *) as
    the first argument as shown in the protos, closes: #61497
  * trunc/floor: documented correctly in this release, closes: #65683, #65684
  * Hurd maintainers say this can be closed, closes: #54154
  * I'm pretty sure this isn't an issue anymore, else potato wouldn't be
    releasing, closes: #35049
  * Sorry this isn't a glibc bug. The kernel handles error returns on a
    failed executable. Most likely this is bin_interp's problem, but I
    seriously doubt it will be fixed because of conventions, standards and
    the like, closes: #22301
  * keyenvoy: no longer compiled for linux (it seems), closes: #47560
  * infnan: is defined now, closes: #19264
  * libc5 bug, no longer applies, closes: #11300
  * Make sure we copy over asm-sparc for sparc aswell as "generate-asm.sh"
    script used to generate /usr/include/asm
  * Disable parallel build on sparc (broken for some reason, might not be
    sparc specific)
  * devpts.sh: used a more devfs friendly version from bug submitter,
    closes: #65276
  * libc/postinst: cannot reproduce problem, appears to be user error,
    closes: #64865
  * glibc-doc: this bug is no longer valid, closes: #33759
  * We now use ldconfig from libc6 for all archs, ldso will conform.
  * Change build deps to just "kernel-headers" for non-Hurd archs. With
    mips and other coming down the pipe, this is bound to get ugly if we
    specify the particular version for each.
  * Add checks to automatically detect proper kernel-headers, error out
    otherwise.
  * hurd: add Depends: hurd (>= 20000803) for libc0.2
  * libpthread: soname version is now 0.9
  * debian/libc/DEBIAN/shlibs: bump to 2.1.94
  * libc6: add temporary depend on libdb2
  * debian/rules: check for FAKEROOTKEY, and fail if it's there. We cannot
    build under fakeroot, we need real rewt. Fear my hacking skillz.

    Removed; applied upstream.

    Removed; applied upstream.
  * debian/patches/arm-string.dpatch:
    Remove string/endian.h part (applied upstream) and rename to arm-ieee754.
  * Disable building of $(libc)-pic, the boot-floppies library
    reduction hack doesn't work anyway.
  * Adjusted rules for dpkg-architecture and reworked source unpacking
    to handle snapshot upstream versions better.
  * Use suidmanager for pt_chown.
  * More fully adopt dpkg-architecture system.
  * Correct libc.preinst for sparc.
  * Set sparc shlib_depend to $(libc) (>= 2.1) per request.
